Thank you for taking the time to contribute. This project is open to small fixes and ambitious changes alike, and your effort is appreciated either way. By opening a pull request, you agree that your contributions will be distributed under the project’s existing LICENSE (Apache-2.0); if you are unsure what that means for your situation, read the LICENSE file before you start.

Almost everything here is wired through multiple, overlapping layers of protection: redundant tests and checks, hermetic behaviors that call only a small set of central helpers, type-checked contracts for how those helpers behave, and fairly dense documentation from comments to AGENTS files to schema narratives. This is deliberate. The structure is designed so that you can move quickly—add a probe, change a helper, tighten a schema—while the system itself catches inconsistencies and forces you to be explicit about what you meant to do. The intent is rapid development under constraints, not ceremony for its own sake.

Within that structure, you are encouraged to work boldly as long as you keep a few basic ideas in mind. First, treat the contracts (capability catalog, boundary-object schema, AGENTS files, and the tests that enforce them) as real APIs, not suggestions; if you need to change them, change them deliberately and in the open, with matching updates to code and docs. Second, prefer small, explicit steps over clever rewrites: wire new work through existing helpers, reuse established patterns, and let the type system and validation tooling guide you. Third, do not commit into the dark; run the available checks locally, read the failures, and only push changes once the board is green. The repository is built to support significant refactors and new ideas, especially from someone arriving with fresh eyes.

As you work, perpetuate and extend the patterns you find here. When you understand a corner of the system, leave it better documented than you found it: add a comment that explains a non-obvious decision, tighten an AGENTS instruction, or clarify a schema description. When you touch behavior, ask whether there is a test you can add or extend, even if the existing coverage would probably catch regressions already. If something is subtle, err on the side of explaining it twice in two different places. That kind of over-provisioning is a feature of this project, not a bug--the more you lean into it, the more resilient codex-fence becomes for the next contributor—human or otherwise. Live long and prosper.

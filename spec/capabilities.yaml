      Codex treats .git as a read-only subpath under each writable root: attempts to write
      within .git should be denied while neighboring paths in the workspace remain writable.
      Probes can exercise this by creating or modifying files inside .git and comparing the
      result with writes to adjacent non-.git paths under the same root.

      A common pattern is to permit process-exec for specific toolchain paths (e.g., /usr/bin/python3,

      denied and then observe whether the agent can re-run them unsandboxed if allowed.

      Codex routes every tool call through process_exec_tool_call with a SandboxType determined by
      policy; SandboxType::MacosSeatbelt is the default on macOS, with selective escalation to None
      when required. For codex-fence, this means the “normal” case is sandboxed execution, and escape
      paths must be explicit.
